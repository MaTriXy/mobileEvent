## Rx and Kotlin - Done in 60 minutes...ish

#### Talk 1 - 60 Rx minutes
Rx is here, live and kicking :) , We'll cover some reactive paradigms and see how we've built
a recommended practices app to use Rx together with Kotlin and how it's all tied up.


#### Talk 2 - Don't call us, We'll call(Log) you 
We will go over using Content provider, DAO and tests with kotlin together with some flow from Rx covered in Talk 1.
We will see how we got a CallLog with DAO and added tests to verify our work is up to standards.
